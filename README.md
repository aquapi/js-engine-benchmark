# JS engine benchmark
Benchmark performances of different JS engines.

## Requirements
Install `bun` for scripts and `jsvu` to get JS engines.

```sh
# Install JS engine installer
bun i jsvu -g

# Select the JS engines you want to benchmark
jsvu
```

Change JS engine commands at [run.js](./run.js).

Then you can start running the benchmark:
```sh
bun start
```
